	</p> <p><strong>Project:</strong> Website Redesign</p>

<div id="main"> <h1>Site Analysis</h1>

<div id="intent"> 

	<h2>Site Intent</h2> 

		<p>The Intent of the Theatre Downtown resign is to
increase demographics and make it a local hot spot in the community. The design will focus
on increasing ticket sales, community involvement and donations to maintain the theatre.
We will do this by condensing the eight-page site into six pages of well organized content
to represent the image of the Theatre.</p>

		<p>The redesign will clean up and validate html code due to the over 60 errors in the
current markup. We will incorporate some CSS to give it clean design, readability and easy
maintenance for future events and dates. Meta tags will be fixed and addressed for keyword
and search capability.</p>

	<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
	
	<h3>Website Keywords:</h3>
	
		<p>Orlando Theatre, theatre downtown, theatre, Orlando, theater Orlando, Performing Arts, Orlando Arts, Orlando entertainment.</p>
	
	<h3>Categories:</h3>
	
		<p>ARTS>Community Theatre>United States>Florida</p>

		<p>When analyzing the current market there are about three other local theatres to compete with, they also have a wide range of audiences but their over all goals are the same. After viewing the competitor stats on Alexa.com there is little information and demographics about them. With the redesign our intent is to change that so the Theatre Downtown will active analytics and we can track our demographics and how they interact with site. As I viewed the source code on some of the competitors I noticed they didn’t have any keywords in the META tag or lack one at all.</p>
		
	<h3>Competitor Sites</h3>
	
		<p><a href="http://www.orlandoshakes.org/"> Orlando Shakespeare Theater</a></p>
		
		<p>Global Rank: 2, 027,331</p>

		<p>The Orlando Shakespeare Theater has a clean design and easier readability. They incorporate promotional slide show as their CTA on their home page to give the audience a visual of upcoming events. Their site contains nine links with in the top navigation and as you go through the have an additional side navigation. In this site I think that some of its content should be minimized and important items such the contact form should be easily assessable. The theater is also affiliated with the University of Central Florida, which makes them more popular in the community and for donations.</p>
		
		<p><a href="http://www.madcowtheatre.com/">Mad Cow Theater</a><p>
		
		<p>Global Rank: 4,155,622</p>
		
		<p>Mad Cow Theater has clean layout and design with seven main navigation links with sub-links on each page organize the content. They describe their demographics to potential companies that may want to advertise their business as a well educated upper middle class and reaching an audience of approximately 16,000 in a season. Their CTA on the main also shows upcoming shows and events and clickable links. </p>
		
		<p><a href="http://www.orlandorep.com/">Orlando Repertory Theater</a></p>
		
		<p>This is a community theater as well and is also partnered with the University of Central Florida although most of the performances are ran by college students their production are focused on children and family demographic. Their site is full of bright colors and clean layout. Their main navigation is seven rollovers to sub categories, which makes it easier to navigate to. </p>
		
		<p>Overall, the competition included cleaner layout and user-friendly experience. They also used social networking sites to promote and increase their audience. All of these sites are neglecting SEO and Analytics to increase their search ability and traffic. By viewing the competitor’s sites I have determined that it is crucial to implement a higher number of keywords that are relevant to the demographic, location, genre of entertainment and community.  </p>
